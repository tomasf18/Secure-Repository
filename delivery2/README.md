#### `rep_list_docs <session file> [-s username] [-d nt/ot/et date]`
- This command lists the documents of the organization with which I have currently a session, possibly filtered by a subject that created them and by a date (newer than, older than, equal to), expressed in the DD-MM-YYYY format.

### Authorized API Commands

#### `rep_add_subject <session file> <username> <name> <email> <credentials file>`
- This command adds a new subject to the organization with which I have currently a session. By default the subject is created in the active status. This commands requires a **SUBJECT_NEW** permission.

#### `rep_suspend_subject <session file> <username>`

#### `rep_add_permission <session file> <role> <username>`
#### `rep_remove_permission <session file> <role> <username>`
#### `rep_add_permission <session file> <role> <permission>`
#### `rep_remove_permission <session file> <role> <permission>`
- These commands change the properties of a role in the organization with which I have currently a session, by adding a subject, removing a subject, adding a permission or removing a permission, respectively. These commands require a **ROLE_MOD** permission.

- This command fetches the metadata of a document with a given name to the organization with which I have currently a session. The output of this command is useful for getting the clear text contents of a documentâ€™s file. This commands requires a **DOC_READ** permission.

#### `rep_get_doc_file <session file> <document name> [file]`
- This command is a combination of rep_get_doc_metadata with rep_get_file and rep_decrypt_file. The file contents are written to stdout or to the file referred in the optional last argument. This commands requires a **DOC_READ** permission.

#### `rep_delete_doc <session file> <document name>`

## <i class="fa-solid fa-file-code"></i> How to run the project

### 1. Install dependencies

-- To install the dependencies go to the `delivery2` folder and run the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the server

-- To start the Flask server go to the `delivery2/src/server` folder and run the following command:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

### 3. Run a command

-- Before running a command, ensure you are in the `delivery2/src/client/commands` folder. From there, execute the desired command with the appropriate parameters. For example:

```bash
./rep_create_org org1 user1 User1 user1@gmail.com user1_cred_file
```

**Note:** stopping and starting the server will automatically clear all data both from database and from the local files.

## Tests

-- To run the tests: 
1. Navigate to `delivery2/src` folder.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/test.py -v
```

- For more detailed information, you can run the following command that will show the output of the tests:

```bash
pytest tests/test.py -v -s
```

**Note:** make sure the server is **stopped** before running the tests. The test script will automatically clear all data, start the server and stop it after the tests are done.
